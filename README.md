# CivFix (Civilian Fix)

Developed by Sampreet K, Ricky W, Muhammad Inshal F, Max N

CivFix is a simple way for college students/members of the neighborhood to raise awareness for issues impacting the community. Normally, when soemone comes across broken infrastructure on campus, the "complaint"/"report" system for the school administration is too confusing to use, so these issues go unreported for weeks, potentially months. With CivFix, any user can submit a ticket to our Webapp regarding issues in the community, such as unfilled potholes or unlit streetlights at nighttime, and other users can "upvote" these tickets. Designated admins (school/city officials) can then log in and view the most prevalant issues/problems on campus or in the community (and hopefully adress them). 

We developed the Frontend using HTML and Bootstrap, and setup our backend using Python and Django (with SQLite as our database). We also added Auth0 functionality to simplfy sign-in for new users.
